# Robotic Arm 
		                INSTRUCTION

The program allows you to simulate robot models with six degrees of freedom. In addition, it is possible to lift, freely manipulate and throw the ball.

The table on the right contains the inverse kinematics.
After entering the desired angles of rotation and clicking the "send" button,
the robot will change its position to the desired one.

It is also possible to control the robot with the keyboard. To start, click the "start" button.
Pressing the "stop" button will disable the use of the keyboard.

Control:

1 - 6		---> change joint
Left/Right arrow		---> moving the robot
   'r'		---> resetting the position of the ball
   'a'		---> pick up the ball
   's'		---> throw the ball
   'y'                           ---> default observer position
